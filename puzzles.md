# Puzzles

A puzzle asks you to find the answer or hidden pattern behind something that at first is incomplete or even meaningless (a computer scientist might say it is in [NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_%28complexity%29) or is a [planted problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planted_clique)).
I like writing and solving puzzles of all sorts, especially puzzles in [puzzle hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzlehunt).
I once wrote for and [commentated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqlrJtg-JKg&ab_channel=YewLabs) a crossword tournament.


Below are some of the puzzles I've written for puzzle hunts.
These puzzles usually don't come with any explicit instructions;
if you "figure out" what the puzzle is getting at, there is a natural path
to a single answer word or phrase from each one.
To see how this kind of puzzle works, have a look at the solutions.
